    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Ever see a TV show clip just after watching it on your TV?</p>
    <p>Maybe you're not that paranoid... but you've noticed oddities, right?</p>
    <p>Covered by Cordier is for those aware enough to care. Our iPhone case physically blocks your camera, mics, and LIDAR—because software settings aren’t enough.</p>
    <p>No invasive trackers. No unnecessary data. Just a small operation with one goal: protect your privacy.</p>
    <p>We donate 20% of profits to <a href="https://aiforgood.itu.int/" target="_blank">AI for Good</a>.</p>
